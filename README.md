- Combine network functionality (ping + port scan) in a single visual interface
- Learn to manage threads, progress bars and file outputs with Python
- Experiment with GUI design: custom loading screen, styles and background images

## 🌱 Future Features

- 🔍 Add custom port range selection (e.g., 1–65535)
- 💡 Light/Dark mode toggle
- 📂 Option to export results in `.txt` or `.csv` as well

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-scanner-gui.git
cd network-scanner-gui
```
2. Install dependecies (reccomended: use a virtual environment)
```bash
pip3 install pillow
```
Pillow is required for image handling. Tkinter is built-in with most Python distributions.
3. Run the app:
```bash
python3 network_scanner_gui.py
```
Make sure your assets/ folder contains:
